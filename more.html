            HAVE YOU HEARD OF <span class="garg">GARGATHOR</span>?
        </h1>
        <p>
            <span class="garg">Gargathor</span> is a great and mighty genderless magician from outer space. They came to Earth in a meteor ten thousand years ago, bestowed upon humanity some gifts, and then promptly left. When they return, they will give us three <strong>more</strong> gifts. Isn't that great?
        </p>
        <h2>
            <span class="garg">Gargathor</span>'s Gifts
        </h2>
        <p>
            What they gave 10,000 years ago:
            <div class="gifts">
            <ol>
                <li>Cranberries</li>
                <li>Pizza Hut</li>
                <li>Opposable Thumbs (we didn't have these back then)</li>
            </ol>
            </div>
            When they return, they will give each of their followers a choice between:
            <div class="gifts">
            <ol>
                <li>Infinite Cranberries</li>
                <li>As Many Logs as You can Eat</li>
                <li>A Second Spirit, perhaps to Haunt An Enemy, such as Someone Who Gave You a Veneral Disease</li>
            </ol>
            </div>
